## United Nations ISIL and Al-Qaida Sanctions D3 Force-Directed Graph Visualization

The United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Da’esh), Al-Qaida and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities.  The sanctions, which all nations are required to enforce, include asset freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes.

This application visualizes the relationships (i.e., "connects the dots") between the targets of these sanctions using a force-directed graph rendered using the [D3 JavaScript library](https://d3js.org/).

The deployed [website](https://al-qaida-sanctions.com/) uses publicly-available [data](data/AQList.xml) based on the published [United Nations Al-Qaida Sanctions List](https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1267).

By hovering your mouse pointer over a graph node you can view a tooltip identifying the sanctioned target and its relationships with other sanctioned targets.
